Tier 1: Must-do (Core Interview Focus)





K Closest Points to Origin – Heap/sorting problem.

Find K Closest Elements – Binary search + two pointers.

Top K Frequent Words – HashMap + Heap + sorting strings.

The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix – Good warm-up for heap usage.

Tier 2: Good practice (Strengthen heap and binary search intuition)

Kth Largest Element in a Stream – Streaming/heap maintenance.

Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum – Greedy + heap.

Find Kth Largest XOR Coordinate Value – Prefix XOR + heap.

Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array – String sorting + heap.

Query Kth Smallest Trimmed Number – String manipulation + sorting.
